03,"A collection of doctorate-level technical manuals on Star League terraforming. Quite literally, the chance to save worlds. Or to own them."
04,"A collection of doctorate-level technical manuals on Star League medicine. Start your own Canopus with blackjack and hookers… er, more blackjack and hookers."
05,"A complete and detailed record of SLDF court martial proceedings. Specifically, that of the SLDF vs a Captain K. Marik, regarding conduct on Pollux. May be the last remaining copy in the Inner Sphere."
06,"A copy of every book published by every major publisher on New Kyoto, in English, German and Japanese between 2935 and 2941."

09,"A complete set of 'Mech Maintenance for Dummies books, 2750 edition."
10,"A collection of doctorate-level technical manuals on SLDF military hardware. The Great Houses would sell their own children for these. No, not just Kurita and Liao."

This does include some terraforming, but more 'turn Mars into a semi-habitable world' than the specifics covered by full terraforming."
